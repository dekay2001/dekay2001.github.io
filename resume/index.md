# Professional Experience

**WiseTech Global** Remote,
 _Lead Senior Software Engineer 2023-current_

 ### Responsibilities, Projects, and Accomplishments

 - 2023 Delivered new installer technology for a pluggable application including UI/UX using [Flet](https://flet.dev/) (Python Library) and feature version management with [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/demo/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=NA_Search_Brand&utm_adgroup=Brand_General&utm_term=launchdarkly&matchtype=b&creative=554491127903&device=c&_bt=554491127903&_bn=g&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAwbitBhDIARIsABfFYIL6EJXvHddJTzCrMJNFDKkNLaJDAY4IaA5pqSyfl1GxfRKL2KlJQY0aArj_EALw_wcB).  The application is self updateable and was is able to fully install and upgrade python on a Windows machine, create virtual envrironments, download and install requirements from Artifactory, a pluggable Flask application, and user selected plugins.  Each plugin is updateable.  The installed service and installer technology can be monitored in AWS Cloudwatch and AWS Xray.  Also the service can send notifications to Microsoft Teams.

- 2023 Interviewed and trained software engineers and quality assurance candidates to join and contribute to our team by teaching them how to write feature tests in Python and use AWS EC2 instances and AMIs to test the installer technology and Core-API.

- 2023 Maintained and supported the Core-API product.  This involved troubleshooting requests made from an internally developed mobile application and other 3rd party services including Order AI, and Geostamp.

- Improved the performance of the Profit Tools application by 67% for large customers by optimizing their permissions across their large number of users.
 
**Envase Technologies** Dover, New Hampshire  
_Lead Senior Software Engineer 2020 thru January 24 2023_
 
 
### Responsibilities, Projects, and Accomplishments
 
- 2023 Leading a team of 2 engineers including myself to create a new installer technology for current Profit Tools features.  The new installer technology will be used to install, update, configure, and extend current Profit Tools Core-API functionality.  The effort also includes improving the current system to behave as a pluggable application, that will require very little maintenance from the support team to deliver new features.
 
### Accomplishments as Team Lead Architect and Developer
 
- 2022 Participated in the hiring and interview process of an additional QA automation engineer and software engineer.  Continued leading team members in improving their TDD and design skills.
 
- 2022 Enhanced the Core-API design and Profit-Tools-Core-API application model to support order entry capabilities.
 
- 2022 Researched and presented AWS X-Ray service, presenting it as a possible technology for enhancing the Envase Tracing system.
 
- 2022 Worked with the team to deliver and design Envase Tracing System that will be used internally to provide container status information for trucking companies.  The system utilizes a pipeline of AWS Lambda function calls and webhooks, using Profit Tools as a demo ready system to move towards the Envase Tracing functionality that can be used by any system.
 
- 2022 Successfully delivered the Profit Tools Core API and locally installed service that is used in production by the Envase Mobile application.
 
- 2021 Participated in architecture design and delivery of an Envase identity management system leveraging AWS Cognito, AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda and AWS RDS.  THe system is utilized by internal and external applications to authenticate and authorize applications to access Envase customer TMS systems with varying levels of permissions and scopes. The system is primarily written in Python and PostgreSQL, and is deployed continuously on version updates across three environments and supports 2 and 3 legged authentication.  
 
- 2021 Participated in architecture design and delivery of a restful gateway api to the core Profit Tools TMS utilizing AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS S3, and other cloud service technologies.  The calls are routed to the correct customer systems with authorization and authentication and handled by a locally installed web service that communicates with the Profit Tools model.  Gathered business requirements and communicated with the team to deliver features incrementally to support a phone application and other third party product use cases.  The product and its components are continuously integrated, tested, and delivered as features are completed in weekly sprints.
 
- 2021 Assisted management with growing the development team, interviewing candidates that were a good fit for the team, and pairing with new hires to teach best practices and proper design principles.  Actively leading the team with business and architectural knowledge to deliver quality products on time with test coverage continuously.  Successfully grew the team with several remote and local developers with a variety of skill sets for different purposes.
 
**Valsoft PT**, Dover, New Hampshire  
_Lead Senior Software Engineer, 2019 - 2020_  
_Product Owner, 2017-2019_
 
- Participated in architecture design and delivery of a restful api to the Track and Trace application.  The system is designed to replace old web scraping technology formerly used by the legacy Track and Trace application as well as provide services to third party applications to communicate with one API rather than many APIs to collect important arrival, availability, and last free day information for shipment containers coming in overseas that must be tracked by TMS applications.
 
- Designed and provided an alternative solution to replace the collecting of mileage data required for a business intelligence application that was to be deprecated as part of a company goal.  An unexpected dependency was discovered by another team building the replacement application that was going to be very expensive to replace.  The designed solution worked well and was delivered in time to meet company goals with success.
 
- As product owner and developer, lead the team in design, and delivered a replacement billing/settlements module to replace an older monolothic design with newer programming languages with test coverage and continuous deployment.  The project required getting continuous feedback from stakeholders, making decisions about critical features, and demoing new features.  Delivered new requirements to the team and participated in the design and implementation.  The new system is easily extendable to different accounting packages, and a simpler set of processes to handle billing, brokerage, and settlements use cases.
 
- Designed and delivered a solution for the configuration of a critical Profit Tools EDI system to satisfy enterprise level requirements.  Growing companies were having a poor user experience as they implemented more EDI trading partners.  The solution involved narrowing the scope of the configuration process to optimize performance as well as simplify the process for administrative staff.
 
- Implemented solutions for a business intelligence application that could be used by large and small trucking companies.  Acted as the solo developer maintaining the product and working with the product owner to understand the application data to deliver a highly valued business data solution involving costing and revenue business models.
