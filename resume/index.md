Gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI tools including agentic AI systems, Ollama for local LLM deployment, GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development, and Office 365 AI agents for research and analysis. Collaborated with team members to establish and promote best practices for responsible and effective AI usage in software development workflows, improving team productivity and code quality. Actively researched and evaluated various AI models to identify optimal solutions for specific development tasks.

- 2025 Collaborated extensively with cross-functional teams across WiseTech Global to design and develop a robust, scalable API for the transportation management system. Focused on creating generic, reusable API designs that meet diverse requirements across multiple product teams. Participated in architectural design discussions, requirements gathering sessions, and technical reviews to ensure API consistency, maintainability, and alignment with enterprise standards. Worked closely with stakeholders to balance specific team needs with broader organizational goals, fostering strong cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing.

- 2024 Worked with [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) and researched the [Windows Installer Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-portal) to create an MSI for the Profit Tools application.  The project required reverse engineering an existing installation technology and automating the many manual steps of installing the application as either a client or server.  The bootstrapper application was improved to be able to install this application and its required components to support clean and upgrade installations of the legacy installation.  The installer technology additionally installs a Windows scheduled task to check for and install ugrades to the installed components.  CICD was created to create a new MSI with each new versioned release of the technology. Each release was managed in LaunchDarkly to target customers and machines eligible for upgrades.

- 2024 Migrated a web application UI to use Vue 3 and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) from its originally written Vue 2 and Bootstrap Vue framework. Also the UI was improved to remove the dependency on Axios by implementing a client with a similar interface using Fetch API.

- 2023 Delivered new installer technology for a pluggable application including UI/UX using [Flet](https://flet.dev/) (Python Library) and feature version management with [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/demo/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=NA_Search_Brand&utm_adgroup=Brand_General&utm_term=launchdarkly&matchtype=b&creative=554491127903&device=c&_bt=554491127903&_bn=g&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAwbitBhDIARIsABfFYIL6EJXvHddJTzCrMJNFDKkNLaJDAY4IaA5pqSyfl1GxfRKL2KlJQY0aArj_EALw_wcB).  The application is self updateable and was is able to fully install and upgrade python on a Windows machine, create virtual envrironments, download and install requirements from Artifactory, a pluggable Flask application, and user selected plugins.  Each plugin is updateable.  The installed service and installer technology can be monitored in AWS Cloudwatch and AWS Xray.  Also the service can send notifications to Microsoft Teams.

- 2023 Interviewed and trained software engineers and quality assurance candidates to join and contribute to our team by teaching them how to write feature tests in Python and use AWS EC2 instances and AMIs to test the installer technology and Core-API.

- 2023 Maintained and supported the Core-API product.  This involved troubleshooting requests made from an internally developed mobile application and other 3rd party services including Order AI, and Geostamp.

- Improved the performance of the Profit Tools application by 67% for large customers by optimizing their permissions across their large number of users.
