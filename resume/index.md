_Lead Senior Software Engineer 2020-Current_

### Accomplishments as Team Lead Architect and Developer

- Participated in architecture design and delivery of an Envase identity management system leveraging AWS cognito, AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda and AWS RDS.  THe system is utilized by internal and external applications to authenticate and authorize applications to access Envase customer TMS systems with varying levels of permissions and scopes. The system is primarily written in Python and PostgreSQL, and is deployed continuously on version updates across three environments and supports 2 and 3 legged authentication.  

- Participated in architecture design and devivery of a restful gateway api to the core Profit Tools TMS utilizing AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS S3, and other cloud service technologies.  The calls are routed to the correct customer systems with authorization and authentication and handled by a locally installed web service that communicates with the Profit Tools model.  Gathered business requirements and communicated with the team to deliver features incrementally to support a phone application and other third party product use cases.  The product and its components are continuously integrated, tested, and delivered as features are completed in weekly sprints.

- Assisted management with growing the development team, interviewing candidates that were a good fit for the team, and pairing with new hires to teach best practices and propper design principles.  Actively leading the team with business and architectural knowledge to deliver quality products on time with test coverage continuously.  Successfully grew the team with several remote and local developers with a variety of skill sets for different purposes.

**Valsoft PT**, Dover, New Hampshire  
_Lead Senior Software Engineer, 2019 - 2020_  
_Product Owner, 2017-2019_

- Participated in architecture design and delivery of a restful api to the Track and Trace application.  The system is designed to replace old web scraping technology formerly used by the legacy Track and Trace application as well as provide services to third party applications to communicate with one API rather than many APIs to collect important arrival, availability, and last free day information for shipment containers coming in overseas that must be tracked by TMS applications.

- Designed and provided an alternative solution to replace the collecting of mileage data required for a business intelligence application that was to be deprecated as part of a company goal.  An unexpected dependency was discovered by another team building the replacement application that was going to be very expensive to replace.  The designed solution worked well and was delivered in time to meet company goals with success.

- As product owner and developer, lead the team in design, and delivered a replacement billing/settlements module to replace an older monolothic design with newer programming languages with test coverage and continuous deployment.  The project required getting continuous feedback from stakeholders, making decisions about critical features, and demoing new features.  Delivered new requirements to the team and participated in the design and implementation.  The new system is easily extendable to different accounting packages, and a simpler set of processes to handle billing, brokerage, and settlements use cases.

- Designed and delivered a solution for the configuration of a critical Profit Tools EDI system to satisfy enterprise level requirements.  Growing companies were having a poor user exerience as they implemented more EDI trading partners.  The solution involved narrowing the scope of the configuration process to optimize performance as well as simplify the process for administrative staff.

- Implemented solutions for a business intelligence application that could be used by large and small trucking companies.  Acted as the solo developer maintaining the product and working with the product owner to understand the application data to deliver a highly valued business data solution involving costing and revenue business models.
