Emotions are all I feel this morning.  
 
My alarm went off at its normal time.  
I forgot to turn it off last night.  
I turned over and went back to sleep.
 
I wake up and remember the fire from last night.  
I am grateful for friends and neighbor who joined with his dog.  
I open my eyes and look at my phone.  
One and a half hours have passed.  
There's a couple notifications;
A FaceBook live notification for a yoga class 2 hours earlier.  
A text from a friend.  
A dating app message.  
I review them.
 
I scroll through FaceBook and get caught up in a "Crona Watch" Bob Marley clip.  
I laugh my ass off.  
A Mike Myers and Conan O'Brien clip.  
I laugh again and turn over.  
It's time to get up.  
I shant waste the day.  
 
It's cloudy.  
I don't feel like running.  
I don't feel like yoga.  
There's some shopping I'd like to do.  
I wish I had company.  
A Post Malone song is caught in my head;   Comedown.   
I search for it, flip on my portable speaker, and play it.

I cleaned from the night before.  
I cannot decide what to do.  
I play the song again.  
"Thunder only happens when it's raining".  
A wave of emotion overtakes me.  
I want to write.  
I want to do it at a coffee shop, surrounded by strangers.  
I cannot; (Covid Restrictions).  
I must write, I need an outlet.  
I sit down, hit repeat.  
My dad calls...  
 
...  

Here I am.  
There is no shortage of tasks.  
I must start something.  
Here I go, but first...
 
It's exhausting trying to stay positive.  
It's tiring to maintain mental health.  
Mindfulness is something I value.  
I strive to be better.  
I have plenty of tools to help.  
I do this to help.  
I think it helps.  
There is no break.  
Weakness is a part of life.
