Today while I was cleaning my office, I found a piece of paper. At the top of the sheet in bold lettering **"Eight Limbs"**.  I had kept it around as a reminder of some important lessons I had learned last summer at an ashtanga workshop with [David Swenson](http://www.ashtanga.com/html/bio_swenson_david.html "David Swenson").  The workshop was at [Yoga Vermont](http://www.yogavermont.com/ "Yoga Vermont").  Recently I've been struggling a bit with a forced change in my routine due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The primary reason for cleaning my office was to make it more comfortable for an extended work from home situation due to the virus.  I decided that it would be a healthy exercise to review the worksheet I kept before discarding it.  Perhaps I could find some wisdom that would help me deal with these changing times.  Perhaps writing about it is the perfect solution.

### What I Want to Do
 
This initial post will be a summary of the eight limbs as I learned them from the workshop.  I'll be doing a little research and thinking as I go.  I intend to follow up with a series of eight (or more?) posts, diving into how each limb applies to my daily life in regards to dealing with the world around me during the pandemic of COVID-19.
 
### The Limbs, and (sub)Limbs
The eight limbs are a set of guidelines for how to live a disciplined and purposeful life.  They are sequenced in a way that starts focussed on the outward and work its way inward.
 
``` 
1. Yamas: self restraint, vows of abstention, control
  - Ahimsa: Non-violence
  - Satya: Truthfulness, Honesty
  - Asteya: Non-stealing or Non-misappropriating
  - Brahmacharya: Chastity, Continence
  - Aparigraha: Without possessions
2. Niyamas: fixed observation, rules, precepts established orders
  - Saucha: Cleanliness, Purity
  - Santosha: Contentment, Peaceful
  - Tapah: Fire of Ordeal, A Burning Desire
  - Svadhyaya: Study leading to knowledge of the self
  - Ishvara-Pranidhana: God or Higher Self the target of concentration, Surrender
3. Asana: posture comfortably held, seat
4. Pranayama:  regulation of breath, restraint of breath
5. Pratyahara: withdrawal of senses
6. Dharana: concentration, fixing of the mind
7. Dhyana: meditation, contemplation, reflection
8. Samadhi: profound meditation, putting it all together ```
 
To give credit where credit is due, I feel I must mention that all the information listed so far about the eight limbs of yoga come from *The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali*.   These are a collection of 196 Sanskrit sutras (aphorisms) on the theory and practice of yoga.
