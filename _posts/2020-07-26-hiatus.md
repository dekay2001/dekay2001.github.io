It's been a while since I made an entry and I am not surprised.  The 2 month hiatus is an indication of my seasonal depression.  It may be years before the trend can easily be identified by my posts, and this year was a bit different because of COVID.  Nonetheless, I am checking in because I know I've been putting it off.  As summer approached and the world started lightening up in the literal sense, my mood improved greatly.  The month of May yielded more than 100 miles of running outside.  The month of June included a Mount Madison and Adams summit.  The world started opening with the summer, and the quality of my life improved.
 
I can't credit it all to the reopening.  Reflection and more time to myself in the spring months gave me a chance to apreciate some of the positives that COVID brought me.  Old friendships flourished as more time was available for activities such as running.  New freindships also grew with sidewalk meetings and backyard "cafes".  New reading materials were brought to attention and a rekindled interest was sparked.
 
I'm still me.  The things in life that I love will always be a part of my personality.  I'll likely  have more entries in the fall that are inspired by sadness.  As a tool this blog site will serve a purpose.  I will notice patterns, and I will likely grow from it.
