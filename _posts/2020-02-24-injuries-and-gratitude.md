### Injuries Suck
 
Tonight while I was guiding myself through a modified primary series ashtanga practice, I noticed something big for myself.  Even though I wasn't able to go at the pace I am used to because of a recent injury, I was happy.  My body craved the practice, and I was rewarding it.  The thing is, I wasn't just rewarding myself physically.  During the practice a thought crossed my mind; If I hadn't recently injured my back, I wouldn't be as satisfied with my workout.  
 
### April Fools! (ACL reconstruction 2014)
 
To take a step back and not advance in my yoga practice, or really in any part of my life, I often beat myself up inside.  Furthermore, I have a deep fear of incapacitating injuries.  It's not just the physical pain, but the psychological pain that I am not free and in control of my life.  The biggest instance of this in my life was when I tore my ACL in rec league basketball 6 years ago, almost down to the date of this post.  The diagnosis took longer than I liked, and I didn't have reconstructive surgery until April 1 (April Fools so funny!).

I knew that the amount of time to recover fully from this surgery was likely more than a year.  My brain fast forwarded to Feb. of the following year, I would be 33 years old, and summer would be spent largely doing physical therapy without possibilities of hiking or physical activities that I typically looked forward to.  Largely, this injury contributed towards my depression.
 
### Something Amazing Happened
 
One thing I didn't anticipate is the level of gratitude I would have when physical therapy was over, and I was able to return to my yoga practice.  It was around this time that a shift in my life was occurring.  I had started reading a number of self improvement themed books and my outlook got better as I was able to do more and more.  Now I see that time in my life as pivotal to my emotional and mental development.

Tonight I was reminded of those times.  It was last Wednesday that I injured my back doing seemingly nothing.  Tonight was the closest thing to normal activity that I've seen since then.  I am grateful for the reminder.
