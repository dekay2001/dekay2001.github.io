## Transitions and Reflections, a Year in Review

### The Descent and the Tool

This year was full. Full of emotions, discovery, challenges, and revelations. It was humbling. It was a roller coaster. Starting with a rickety ascent, I was desperately trying to be a certain kind of human as I navigated a life situation I hadn't found myself in before. I knew where I wanted to be, and as I was reaching the top, my world was rocked and the track took me on the familiar descent to lows that I hadn't experienced for more than a decade. The lows were met in the early spring as I dealt with falling into deep depression. The reality of my situation really set in, and if things were going to change, I needed to take action, and for me, SSRIs were the answer. I had been on them before, a tool in the toolbox of life that I am lucky to have.

### Rising Up

In retrospect, the turnaround was quick. By the time summer hit, I was in a much better place mentally. The additional tools I had developed over the prior decade were supercharged. I was able to take some quality time off, return to my running groups, and get some much needed sun at the beach. I parlayed my PTO into planning another end of summer trip to Spain where I would go on a pilgrimage. 

Walking became a new favorite activity, as I found myself becoming present in my environment. It's different from running, as running is a more introspective experience. I have a deeper appreciation for both in light of all this. 

I was also promoted into a lead role in my company and this synergized well with the leadership role I was beginning to embrace in my running group. I discovered that the skills I had been developing while staying on top of AI trends synergized well and even complemented my work as a selected juror in August. This lead to new friendships and community developments for myself. I was healing.

I discovered that my fear of SSRIs numbing my feelings and personality was unfounded. In fact, I was able to experience unconditional love like I hadn't experienced before. 

### The Question

A question came up in the fall, as I was thinking about the spring when I would likely be weaning off of the SSRIs. "Why would you get off of them?" For one, I always assumed I would, as I didn't want to be dependent on medication my whole life. I don't like dealing with side effects, and somehow I thought I wasn't my fully authentic self. Song (music) that affected me when I was off of the SSRIs didn't hit the same way while I was on them. 

There is a deeper philosophical question in play in all this. Am I more my authentic self on or off the medication? While on SSRIs, my energy has skyrocketed. Ideas, ambition, and execution have resulted in happiness and contentment in scenarios that would have been more troubling before. I'm better able to move through emotional and physical challenges more quickly while I'm on them. I'm better equipped to meet my goals and achieve things I may not have had the energy otherwise to achieve, even further synergizing my positive state. And this is where I am humbled. Maybe I've been wrong all along about what it is to be authentic.
