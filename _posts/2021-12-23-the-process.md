Loss sucks so bad, but it gets easier.  I remember when I was a kid I was terrified of losing my parents to an incurable disease and my mom had to assure me that in fact my dad and she would not die of aids or cancer, so I should not worry so much.  My first real loss was when I was three and my grandfather died.  I was too young to really know what was going on, but I'm pretty sure that was the first time I saw my dad get emotional.  It was a brief moment in my aunt's kitchen, and I was rushed to go to bed by my older cousins.  I suppose it was to spare me this pain of seeing my invincible dad crying.
 
The first real losses I understood were the deaths of my pets.   I remember crying a lot, the pain was real.  Even as a young teenager when our dog ran away and died in the woods, I remember being more emotional about it than my brothers, which confused me.  
 
The most painful was my grandmother in 2005.  I was in college and my whole family was together in the hospital sitting by her side, while she was being ventilated.  We were close, and I cried for what felt like weeks thinking about her death, and how for some reason I thought she was only hanging on to see me graduate college and see my cousin's baby be born.
 
The next most painful experiences I had were related to breakups.  They felt a lot like the death of a loved one.
 
After a lot of growing up I acquired some skills for dealing with these emotions through mindfulness and meditation.  Adopting a Buddhist mentality, I began reminding myself that everything is impermanent, including the pain I was feeling.
 
I didn't really know how much this would help me until the death of my memere.  It was the first time I didn't feel like the world was crumbling after a loss of someone close.  I was 33 years old, and somehow I do remember feeling guilty that my pain wasn't as great as before.
 
It's been just over 5 years since then, and almost 2 years into a pandemic.  My last remaining grandparent, my pepere lost a fight to COVID.  The loss felt similar to my memere, and this time the hardest part was the fact that our family didn't get to see him when he was sick, and because of the pandemic we hadn't seen him for months.  For myself, I only saw him once since the start of the whole thing.  
 
It feels wrong and weird that life goes on.  One day we are here, and the next day we aren't.  Death meditations have taught me that the only thing that can help us prepare for when that day comes, is working on our mind, as we all face death alone.  Our bodies, our families, our possessions, none of them can help us.  We all experience this fate.  If in fact there is anything we can take with us, it's our mind.
