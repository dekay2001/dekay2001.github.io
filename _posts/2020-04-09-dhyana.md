The seventh limb on the journey to true happiness is dhyana.  One sits in silence observing their own mind as one focuses.  This is meditation.  The focus could be on the breath.  Withdrawing the senses from the world around, one observes.  An endless stream of thoughts pour in, distracting from the point of focus.  Noticing this happening, or even the lack of this happening, takes work.  This is dhyana.
 
### Dhyana: meditation, contemplation, reflection
 
As stated in an earlier entry, traversing the eight limbs is about journeying inward as we discover what our body and minds need.  Through meditation, it is possible to experience pure bliss, as time is transcended in our own minds.  
 
As I've been spending most time at home during this pandemic, there have been more opportunities for me to sit in silence and practice dhyana, however I haven't taken advantage.  This is the first entry of the eight limbs I've made without any distractions.  It is odd to me that something as simple as sitting in silence, focusing on the breath can be such a difficult thing to do.  Practicing dhyana presents an opportunity for creativity and self discovery.  The mind is calmer when we practice.
