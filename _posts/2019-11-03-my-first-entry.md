For a long time I have been thinking about starting a blog.  I didn't just want to start writing a blog.  I wanted to create the blogging platform itself and eventually start adding content.  So here it is!  I apologize for any surprises and shortcomings of the styling and layout of the site.    
 
Also, I apologize for organization of the content.  I have a lot of ideas and thoughts rattling through my brain.  One of the main reasons I wanted to write a blog is because I want to wrangle in those thoughts and use them for good rather than evil.  
 
**Disclaimer:**
There’s a good chance that this will be a ragtag mixture of thoughts from books I’m reading, technical discoveries, emotions I am feeling, and activities I enjoy.  I’d like this to be a tool for myself to help improve the quality of my own life.  My opinions are my own, and I expect them to change over time.  
 
Thanks for joining me, and taking the time to walk through my brain.
