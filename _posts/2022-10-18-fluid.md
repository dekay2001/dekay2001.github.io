## Fluid
 
Water is an element of change.  It can maneuver around any opstical, and it can even bring down a mountain.  Water brings life.  It makes up 60 percent of our bodies.  
 
The forecast today, the day of my annual solo hike, there was a 17 percent chance of rain before I started.  When I got to the top, it was 100 percent.  Had it started before I started, I might have had a harder time getting going. I ended up not minding so much, and I knew that I could draw inspiration from the rain.

On this same day I still have a scheduled float session.  A float session is a sensory deprivation experience where someone can submerge themselves in highly concentrated salt water that keeps the body buoyant.  The temperature is perfect so that you don't get cold, and you also don't get wrinkled skin.  The pods or tubs have button options that allow you to turn on or off lighting or music, but the idea is to submerge yourself in silence, so I usually leave them off.  This has potential to be a deeply relaxing and meditative experience.
 
While coming down the mountain soaking through all my clothes, the natural feeling is to look forward to being dry again, so it is ironic that the second half of my reflective day is largely geared around soaking myself once again in water.  I had to be careful on my way down, as the ground was covered with slippery wet leaves.  Best I could tell I was the only one hiking today, so an injury could have been bad.  My perception of it all was positive, just the same.  
 
From my previous experience with running in the rain and canoeing with friends I knew that there are intangible benefits to a physical challenge that involves wetness and discomfort.  Many experiences can take the form of however we choose to perceive what is going on around us.  Sometimes it is hard to see the positive of a potentially negative situation.  This is especially true for someone dealing with depression.  Water is fluid in nature, neither good nor bad, and constantly changing direction while maintaining its essence.  When dealing with emotions, I can't imagine a better way to simply Be oneself.  I capitalize "Be" in the previous sentence to capture the essence of being.  No matter how we are or how we feel, we are in our natural state and it is a perfect place to Be.  We are fluid in nature just like water.  There are intangible benefits of our feelings even when those feelings are negative.  All One can do, is practice being fluid.  All we have to do, is simply Be.
