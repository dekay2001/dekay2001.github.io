# “Minds are like flowers; they open only when the time is right.” – Stephen Richards

High is how I feel.  Yesterday it was snowing in the morning, and even though I practiced yoga and finished some chores, I didn't really accomplish much of anything after lunch.  It was the first "rest" day from running I had taken since the Monday prior, and I managed to fill my day with some technical  challenges, reading, and a lot of television; the Netflix original Atypical has taken over my television life.  I don't want to write about that.  What I want to write about is today.
 
Today I woke up and got on my yoga mat.  My home practice typically is one where I take the time to set up my surround sound system to play some Desert Dwellers radio on Pandora.  The primary series in ashtanga is traditionally practiced in silence, allowing the breath to be a point of focus.  See my 8 limbs entry on dharana on April 6th , which pops into my mind quite often since reading about it.  
 
Today is Sunday, a day I used to get up and rush to get laundry started, followed by grocery shopping.  All of this is changed since covid-19 rules.  Sunny, the temperatures were set to be as high as 60.  After a lazy and snowy Saturday, I set out to plan my day, a perfect day for a longer run than usual.  I would drink some water, eat some yogurt, trail mix, and a few bites of macaroni salad left over from my new Friday night ritual of grocery shopping.  I downloaded a new running app and looked for ways to add a mile or two on to the six mile loop through New Castle.  With plans set, I stopped along the way for some iced coffee as a reward for after my run.  My energy levels felt high.
 
After about an hour and 15 minutes I completed my 8.3 mile loop and walked around town sipping my iced coffee.  A quick text to a friend to see if they were around in the area yielded no after run buddies, and so I went home.  
 
I wasn't finished.  When I got home I polished off the remaining macaroni salad and took a shower.  I left my car parked in the driveway so I could clean out the inside after my shower.  There's something about the inside of a car after the first detailing of the year after a long winter of salt, sand, and snow trudged in from the long winter months that is very rewarding.  
 
Is there a better time to clean the garage with the car in the driveway than a sunny breezy April day?  Let's fix the gutter too. And now lets clean out my flower beds knowing that somewhere under all those leaves and leftover debris from last year there may be some new iris buds.  Finally, lets retreat inside and call each of my parents to catch up.

PS.  As I was getting ready to post this, I received a facetime call from my best friend and his family.  My mind is open.
