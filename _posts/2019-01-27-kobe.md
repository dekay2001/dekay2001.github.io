Today is the day following the tragic death of 41 year old Kobe Bryant, his 13 year old daughter, and 7 others in a helicopter crash.  Yesterday I was changing the channel to the Celtics game to see a picture of Kobe and the announcers using the descript words "he was..." with so many accolades, I began to understand and fear what I thought they were saying.  It didn't feel real.  He was drafted around the same time that I had really starting watching basketball, after my favorite team the Seatle Supersonics were eliminated from the finals by Michael Jordan.  For the majority of my adult life, I was against the Lakers.  Kobe was like Jordan, the man who would always succeed when I wished he wouldn't.
 
In his memory, I post this photo of me and my best friend attending the Lakers vs. Celtics in the NBA finals.

I am grateful to have seen him in person.  To witness his greatness on the court on the grandest stage was truly an honor.

Living in the present moment, remembering to enjoy the time we have.
