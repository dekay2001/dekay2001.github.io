# "Balls"
A few people told me that what I did took a lot of balls.  I don't necessarily see it through that lens.  Years ago I am unsure I would have agreed and I don't know if I would have jumped at the opportunity.  At this point in life, saying "no" seems like an impossibility. Saying "yes" to an experience that embodies my true self is a no brainer.  It couldn't have been any other way.  From the moment I said yes, I knew it would be an experience I'd cherish.
 
The phone conversation with Chris went something like this...
 
Me:  Hey how's it going?
 
Chris:  The answer to this question may depend on your answer to mine...
 
Me: Oh really, what's up?
 
Chris:  Would you be willing to perform Rapper's Delight at an open mic on September 3rd with me on base, and my friend on drums.
 
Me: Yes.

I had never performed anything before and I don't play an instrument.  The closest thing I had done to this point was karaoke a few times.  Music is something that I've always felt strongly while listening to, and up until this point I never had any aspirations of performing in front of anyone.
 
So why did I do it?  
 
# "Blown Away"
"Blown away" is how I felt last week after performing at an open mic as a guest rapper for a friend's open mic appearance.  It's been just over a week and I can't shut up about it.  There wasn't much prepraration on my part, with the exception of the four days before when I acquiesced to the fact that it was indeed going to happen.  Chris and I disagreed when he asked me to do it, but I stand by my stance that he asked me if I would do it just one week earlier.  I agreed without hesitation, confident that I knew the words and had even attempted the long version karaoke a year or so earlier.  I was only confident I'd do the short version from the 90's remake with Erick Sermon, Keith Murray and Redman (Def Squad).  This was the version I knew, loved, and grew up with watching on MTV when we were in high school.  
 
## First Run
Chris contacted me on the Sunday morning before about coming over to practice in the afternoon. Shit got real for me quickly and I decided to only listen to that song on a loop over and over.  I did this on the drive to, during my 7 mile run, and on the way home.  I stumbled through some parts, confusing some lyrics and verses with the longer version of the song that I'm not as familiar with.  "Hotel motel holiday inn..." was a verse I had trouble shaking, but not specifically because it is a popular lyric from the long version, but more specifically because there is a Dr. Dre song I loved with a verse that started that way, but ended very differently.  The Dre version of the song is much more explicit, and not something I wanted to roll into by mistake for my first ever open mic!  I obsessed over the correct lyrics, and tightening up my transitions and finding time to breathe as I belted out lyrics on repeat for the next 4 days.  The Monday before, I drove to Chris's friend Riddler's (drummer) home for our first and only band practice before Thursday.  We ran through it twice along with another song he was doing with his friend Liz as a vocalist.  Chris plays the base, and this 3 song set was completely manifested by his creativity and desire to perform.  We mostly killed the rehearsal with a couple bumps, but I was feeling confident afterwards that I'd tighten up my part and would kill it on Thursday.  
 
## My Entourage
 
During quarantine, working from home, we had company wide coffee breaks scheduled on Thursday afternoon, featuring questions of the day.  The question on this day was asking about new skills or other things we may have been doing since quarantine, and fresh in my head was my friend's request to perform the following week.  I blurted out that I was possibly performing the rap song at an open mic, not expecting an immediate reaction from any coworkers.  After I said it, I understood that there was more interest in seeing this amongst my peers than I expected and started to back pedal, saying that I figured it was 50-50 whether or not it would actually happen, as it depeended on a few other people and schedules as well.  If my coworkers were going to go, I felt I should also tell Aj.
 
## Tuesday
 
Aj is a friend in the yoga community who I have travelled with as an organizer of yoga retreats.  One of the retreats I drew her name from a hat as a person I was to get to know and give a gift from the heart to at the end of the retreat without her knowing I was doing this.  A Rapper's delight verse performed by yours truly was part of her gift, and the first time I had ever performed it outside of a club or setting amongst friends.  It was received better than expected, and I'm sure I must have mentioned it to Chris before, hence his request for me to do it.  
 
My text: AJ, I'm doing an open mic rendition of Rapper’s Delight on Thursday night at Shooters in Exeter for a freind.  Since I first sang part of it in Portugal for you, I thought I would share.
 
Initially she told me she was bringing her mom to the airport, but asked for the time anyways.  She was very excited about this news.
 
Another friend who I met in Portugal is my friend Pat, who lives in the same town as where the show is.  I told him and invited him to attend.  He was unsure as he had some other things going on.
 
A third friend from the Portugal retreat also sent me a text that night talking about hanging out soon, and I responded telling her about how busy I was and mentioned what was going on.  Courtney told me she was going for sure, and I was happy but not certain that she actually would.
 
## Wednesday
 
On Wednesdays I religiously attend a yoga class in Portsmouth that my good friend Karyn teaches.  I knew she'd be happy to hear about this thing that was happening so I thought I'd tell her in person.  As I prepared for the class in my typical quarantine corner spot, I started to tell her, and she stopped me saying "I know, I'm going with Aj and another friend".  Shocked that she knew and also that she knew Aj was going before I knew Aj was going I checked my phone for notifications.  Exactly one minute before I received a text from Aj saying she was going with Karyn.... This was my first mind blown moment.  I wasn't really expecting anyone to go.
 
## Thursday Morning
 
I received a text Thursday morning while I was working from an older friend "Matty G" who lived nearby in Berwick.  He wanted to get lunch, and had been reaching out recently about getting together, and I had been blowing him off for a while because of my schedule.  On this specific day I had a dentist appointment and then the performance, and simply didn't think I'd be able to work it into my schedule.  I told him all this, and he asked if he could go with his girlfriend Liz.  CRAZY!  
 
By now I was getting really excited, and I was super confident that I was going to kill it and people would be surprised by my delivery.  I couldn't not mention it at the dentist office, and joked about how I should have him put a grill.  My dentist told me he would go and hook me up with a gold tooth!  He was joking of course, dentists make jokes, ha!
 
## On to the show
Shooter's is a bowling alley and bar that serves food and has an outdoor  area with picnic tables.  There is a patio where bands set up to play and occasionally they host these open mic nights.  It is located in Exeter NH and I had never been there before.  I arrived at the planned time of 7pm and the parking lot was packed.  As I pulled in there was a big ass truck pulling out, so I was luckily able to get a spot.  What was I getting myself into?  Chris and Riddler were already outback so I met up with them.  It was all pretty exciting.  Not long after, we were able to grab a picnic table.  Before I knew it Matty G. and Liz arrived, and so did Chris's wife Ali.  Our other singer, Liz, arrived as well, and I was fielding messages from the other friends I was expecting.  By 8 pm, everyone had arrived, Courtney, Karyn, Aj, and Pat from my friends group, and Rick and Amanda from my work.  We were slated to go on at 8:25.
 
Anticipation was building.  I was fully confident and expected I would slay the song.  But first Chris would perform an acoustic rendition of "Hey Ya" by Outkast, and then he would call me up for my song, and then he would call up Liz to perform "All About the Base", a Megan Trainer song.  
 
Chris surprised me with his voice in the first song.  Apparently he is a decent singer.  He called an audible before playing this song, as it wasn't originally intended to be the first song, and he nailed it.  When I was called up, Karyn and Amanda started recording from opposite sides of the stage, unaware that they were both recording the performance.  As we got going I started moving to the beat.  "I said hip hop de hibbe..." and from then on out I belted out the lyrics.  I knew my delivery was strong as I danced around on the stage and looked out to all my friends to the left bobbing their heads around.  Chris to my right, jamming plugging away on my critical baseline that would carry me through the entire song.  Half way through the song, a large group of people got up and started dancing.  This shit was really happening and it was great.  I messed up in a couple spots but quickly managed to recover while laughing it off to the sound of the “WOOS” in the crowd.  It was a mother effing hit!  Really I don't think it could have gone better.  Chris was also blown away.  He noted that someone at the beginning said "aww no way!" when he started the baseline, but I hadn't noticed.  After my song, Liz stood up and started her song, while I stayed on stage with some shakers to support her and also started to come down from my high.  I got the party going, and she kept it going.  The crowd was having a blast.  
 
## Afterwards
It still gets me going just thinking about it.  All my friends and coworkers who came to support me were thrilled.  Amanda posted the video on our Microsoft teams account.  Karyn sent her video to our breakfast club group.  I didn't watch right away.  I knew I had done well and didn't want to hear my critical voice judging my performance just yet.   Everyone in the office who watched it gave kudos.  The breakfast club group did as well.  I got copies of the videos and sent them off to my parents before posting them on Facebook.  At last I was able to sleep the Friday night afterwards and even better on Saturday.  I ended up going to visit Chris and helped him stack wood in an effort to be more grounded.  We talked about doing it again and what other songs we had at our disposal.  I'm not sure what is in store, but I do know it will be hard to top Rapper's Delight.  It was a perfect song for the perfect crowd at a perfect time in my life.
