Why is it so hard, my thoughts are racing  
back and forth, these fingers are pacing  
sorting out the feelings, of discomfort, desire  
there's got to be a meaning, so I'm looking to fire  
up some creativity juices, sit down and read  
anxiety building, but not from these pages  
I'm thinking of working, just shut up and breath  
why am I so hard to please, these voices inside  
they should have asked me, if this was something  
I even wanted to be, a mentor who teaches  
it's not an empty feeling, but something is wrong  
the good feelings are fleeting, the shores of my borders  
look up at the ceiling, leave me alone and just let me be  
the genius I am as I write all these documents, explain them I must  
But what are my options?  Get up from the seat push all aside  
I walk to the restroom for a moment to hide.  
I just want to solve it, and put it behind me,   
Instead I must defend my designs.  
Could have finished by now, if it was just me  
Another distraction, an email popped up  
Take a look at this stuff, they want my opinion  
I give them my feedback and it isn't enough  
Tomorrow discussions are bound to get rough.  
Not finished my task, can't let this shit go  
emotions run high, I want to just blow.   
Can I retire?
