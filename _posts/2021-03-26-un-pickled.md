### What am I doing here?  How do I focus?  What is wrong?  How do I fix it?  
 
These are the thoughts I have as I sit at my local coffee shop and attempt to make sense of my current mood.  "Get that pickle out of your ass" is the line I keep repeating to myself.  It's a line from So I Married an Axe Murderer that I always found to be a funny phrase.  The idea of a pickle being in anyones ass seems a suitable reason to feel irritable.  It's not too different from some other phrases that come to mind.  "You have a hair across your ass" is another funny one.  "Cross" is also a fun word.  Just saying to myself "don't get cross with me" seems like something that a waspy person from another century might say.
 
Let's be real here.  I have nothing to complain about.  For all intensive purposes, life is going as well for me as I could ever ask.  What problems does a successful software engineer who has his own home and has a paid day off go to the gym and sit in a coffee shop to analyze his feelings really have?  Not much, unless of course I have a pickle in my ass?  Since I seemed clear of all pickles and other obstructions this morning, it must be something else.  That is why I am here.
 
### Exercise
 
So far I went to the gym.  Usually exercise helps with my mood.  Even when I wake up and feel like I've already done enough exercise the previous day or week or however long it has been, it's usually worth it to get up and get my body moving.  Sometimes it's yoga, running, or lifting weights.  Today was weights, and I did not feel like doing it.  I really felt more like a yoga session, but I'm so damn regimented and haven't been to the gym to lift weights for almost a week, so I forced myself to go.  I'm not sure that was the right decision for my mood.  It may have been better to go with the flow for what my body was feeling, but the point is I needed to do something.  If I'm going to walk around with a pickle in my ass unhappy, I may as well do something good for myself that I can appreciate later, so I lifted.  
 
### Writing / Socialization
 
Note that I didn't say socializing.  I think my recent lack of socialization and failed attempts to get together with friends has frustrated me.  Today I am supposed to meet a friend for lunch, so ideally that would fix the problem.  Since I have been feeling cross, I didn't wake up super excited about this, but I'm doing it anyways.  Again it's something I think I need to do, as it may break my cycle, and when has anyone ever been sad that they spent more time with their friends?  
 
To bridge the gap, here I am writing at the coffee shop, listening to music, and focusing my thoughts on my mood in a positive way.  It seems to be helping.  I still haven't noticed a pickle, but the disgruntledness is dissipating.  
 
### Action / Planning
 
I think I also have been trying to focus on goals for myself that I feel slightly blocked on.  It's not a full on block, as I'm sure I could do just about anything I set my mind to if I had the determination and desire to do them.  I've been focussed on small things in my life that I see could use improvement, such as a new couch, new home, new dresser, etc, that would be nice upgrades.  I don't do these things either because I can't find the right thing, don't have the enery and desire to make a big change.  Also I am suspicious of anything like an item that would give me fleeting satisfaction.  I have a hard time convincing myself that a new couch or dresser would be something that would bring me long term joy and prevent another pickle from finding its way up my ass.  A home is a big thing.  There are a few other unknown circumstances and a crazy housing market that has me hesitant to make such a jump too.  Where I live and the right home I do think could have bigger implications for my future happiness and well-being.  I may need to focus some energy on this, or perhaps investing in my current living situation...  TBD.
