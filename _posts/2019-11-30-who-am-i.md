Today I find myself stuck.  
I want answers.  
What is my place in this world?
 
Here's how I see myself.
 
### To Those Around Me
I am a runner.  
I am a software engineer.  
I am a yogi.  
I am a friend.  
I am a son.  
I am a brother.  
 
### In the Stars
I am a Libra (sun).  
I am a Scorpio (moon).  
I am a dog (Chinese Zodiac).  
 
### Surveys Say
I am a connector-maven.  
I am an ENFJ.  
I am a pitta.  
 
### My Critical Inner Voice
I am alone.  
I am vulnerable.  
I am not good enough.  
I am broken.  
I am undeserving.  
I am incapable.  
 
### My Experience and Resolve
I am not my thoughts.  
I am the witnesser.  
I am more than my actions.  
I am the feelings behind my actions.  
I am okay.
