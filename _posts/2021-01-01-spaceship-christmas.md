*To the beat of Spaceship: Earth, Mop Mop*
 
Nothin around, nothing to see  
Take my dog for a walk, oh shit its just me  
No dog no cat, just me in my flat  
Writing a rhyme, just passing the time    
Tik-tok goes the clock  
It's my time, to shine  
This little light on mine  
I might go blind  
Trying to find myself  
Lets press rewind  
Like yesterday, I was in my hay day  
Walked along a path and look back to say  
What a tumultuous year, aint nothing to fear   
Put that shit in the past so fast, no mask   
Nothing to hide, nothing but pride  
Lions they stalking, where you walking  
Lace em up you be running instead talking  
About your wealth, can't help yourself  
Better watch your health, elf on the shelf  
Gonna bust your ass,  
From the rear view mirror, it's not easy to steer  

What lies ahead,  around the corner  
That little bombshell, what's in store  
She was sexy as hell, I couldn't ignore her  
Pulled out her chair for that golden blonde hair  
She cracked a smile and it took me a while  
Get my shit in gear as I pull my chair near  
She called me out for being so forward  
I had to acknowledge that she went to college  
No fooling her, I new where I stood  
It didn't really matter, it was time to flatter  
She took a sip of my drink so started stammer  
This cats in the bag, not trying to bang her   
I play the long game, gotta keep this flame 
Hot as the fire, I had to admire  
The brain on this chick, started licking my lips  
She kept me guessing, she got me flexing  
My emotional knowledge, pour it on thick, thicker than pourage  
 
I could see it on her face, we were on the same pace  
Wanted to make a case to get out of this place  
Suggest we take a walk, to the local park  
Took her by the hand like a proper man  
Lead her down the alley and she jumped ahead  
Started skirting down a path I didn't intend  
To a run down house, wasn't on the mend  
In a beautiful area, thought I could marry her  
This was rare for me, but there was more to see  
We carried along, to this alone graveyard  
She new the history, even better than me  
Though I'm from the area, it couldn't be scarier  
But not from  ghouls nor ghost  
Of relationships passed tense, I was on the ropes  
This girl was intense, she spoke to my soul  
Want to keep the night going, it's almost over  
We'll do it again, that's what she said  
Cherish the moment, so long as we hold it  
We're about to part ways, and on the same page  
Pulled her in by the hips, we started to kiss  
A night to remember, pleasure to meet you miss.
