## Reflections

An inspired song with a little help from A.I.

Title: Reflections

Verse 1:  
Am I too busy to remember?  
Life's questions, in fading embers.  
Past, a melody, slipping away fast,  
Echoes of progress, moments cast.  

Pre-Chorus:  
Let's do the next thing,    
Appreciation for life, it'll bring.  
Objectively speaking, in reflections find,  
Rhythm to the questions of the mind.  

Chorus:  
Am I complacent, or am I free?  
In the echoes, my soul's decree.  
Striving for more, the melody sings,  
Devils in the details, where the heart clings.  

Verse 2:  
Am I accomplished, am I fit?  
The whispers answer, doubts commit.  
Striving for more, a constant yearning,  
In the silence, new lessons learning.  

Pre-Chorus:  
Devils in the details, intricate design,  
Not everyone can walk in shoes like mine.  
Am I a good friend, am I true?  
The echoes respond with a gentle cue.  

Chorus:  
Am I good to family, am I good to me?  
In the echoes, a symphony.  
Mostly reaching out, a fading vow,  
Weekly rituals, echoes in the now.  

Bridge:  
Mother's health and time, a tender grace,  
Whispers in harmony, a warm embrace.  
Running woes, therapy's gentle touch,  
Investing in echoes, the notes clutch.  

Interlude:  
Friends and touch, like distant keys,  
Stress-free work, a gentle breeze.  
J.P.'s wisdom, in each moment,  
Treat yourself, find the atonement.  

Chorus:  
Am I too busy, or am I free?  
In life's tale, find the key.  
Striving for more, a melody bold,  
In quiet moments, stories told.  

Outro:  
Echoes of life, in a closing chord,  
A song of reflection, the soul's reward.  
Whispers of questions, unfurl,  
In life's music, find a new swirl.
