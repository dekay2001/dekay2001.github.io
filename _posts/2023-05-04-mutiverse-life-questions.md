## The Multiverse and Life Questions

The "multiverse" has been on my mind recently. Marvel has made it very popular in recent years with films like Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, but the idea of a multiverse is hardly a new concept. Marvel is not the reason it has been on my mind.

Today I continued listening to a Joe Rogan podcast with Michio Kaku where they discussed the idea of quantum computing, the "God equation," and string theory. In this podcast, they discussed the raw computational power of quantum computers and how such computing power could be used to prove or disprove problems like string theory and the idea of a God equation, which in mathematical terms would describe the entire nature of our universe. Digging into string theory, there is the idea of the possible existence of a multiverse.

Additionally, I was listening to a description of a book where the protagonist was able to experience different directions their lives would have taken had events or decisions in the character's life been different. I started thinking a little about my own life and what key moments could have gone differently and then quickly branched off to a close friend's life. This close friend of mine has had a number of passions that he took very seriously. He is the type of guy who goes all-in on the things he loves, and originally cycling seemed to be his big push, until he got injured. Almost to his detriment, he always takes on new personal life goals and challenges and almost inevitably gets injured and is forced to change course. I started wondering how his life, and in turn, my life and our relationship might be different if for any of these interests, he didn't get injured. Part of what makes my friend interesting, and possibly in large part a reason why we are so close, is because of our journeys and growth made in life. Perhaps there is a version of our world where he never gets injured, and we don't grow in the same direction that I know in this one.

With AI going in the direction it's going, and with the possibility that quantum computers could become a reality, the possibility of getting to some next-level existence as a species seems like it may be a possibility in my lifetime. Possibilities seem endless. One of the things I have fantasized about, though it never seemed like a reality, is the idea that I could have every question I ever had or will have answered. Is it possible to know where we came from and where it all goes? Maybe.
