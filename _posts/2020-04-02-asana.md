The third of the eight limbs, **asana** is what most people who practice yoga think about when they think about yoga.  This is the third step on the eight-limbed path.
 
### Asana: posture comfortably held, seat
 
While practicing asanas, the yogi is searching for balance.  Balance of strength vs. flexibility, as well as balance in life.  A super flexible individual should focus on building strength, by resisting going too deeply, while an individual with stiff muscles should work on letting go of resistance, by relaxing into asana.  The asana should be held comfortably for a period of time, and finding this balance is a meditative practice that can be extended off the mat.
 
During this pandemic I've continued to practice yoga and go for longer runs, as my life in general has become less busy.  My lessened social interactions has left me trying to fill the void with increased phone calls and facetime on various technology platforms.  I do not meditate enough and have trouble prioritizing meditation in my life.  In some ways I reach my val hala in my exercises, as well as in my reading and writing.

The above is a picture of the book I was reading while practicing _Viparita Karani_ or "legs up the wall" pose on a day after a longer run.  I think the intention I was going for and trying to explain is summed up nicely by this photo.
