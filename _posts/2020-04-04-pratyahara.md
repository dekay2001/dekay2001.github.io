Limb four of the eight limbs is right in the middle of the journey inward.  It connects the body to the mind, in that any meditation requires withdrawal from the senses.
 
### Pratyahara:  withdrawal of senses
 
Our senses can be thought of as connections from the physical world to the mind.  They exist to be stimulated, feeding information always.  Without the mind, the sense would serve no purpose.  To practice pratyahara is to practice removing the distractions.
 
I'm a very distracted individual.  In this world it isn't easy to detatch from the many stimulants in everyday life.  My phone vibrates, I feel I must look.  I wake up in the morning, I listen to a podcast.  I watch tv, and I want a snack.  A mind can only focus on one thing at a time, so overloading one sense deprives the others.  When there is nothing to see, hear, feal, taste, or smell my mind begins to crave stimulation.  To withdraw from the senses, is to control the mind.  Where the mind goes, the senses must follow.  
 
Recently before essential business was shut down, I had started going to [Flōte, Float Therapy + Wellness Center](https://www.seacoastflote.com/ "Flōte, Float Therapy + Wellness Center").  Basically I float in a foot of tepid salt water in the dark and in silence for an hour.  Its pretty incredible.  I recommend it highly and look forward to being able to do it again once all this passes.
