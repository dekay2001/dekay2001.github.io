Limb six of the eight limbs, the second limb on the path towards meditation.  As pratyahara is to subtraction, dharana is addition.  Instead of withrawing mind from one's senses, dharana is about focusing the mind.
 
### Dharana:  concentration, fixing of the mind
 
While practing ashtanga, a teacher will call attention back to the breath and bundas time and time again.  This kind of focus should be constant during practice.  It's easy to catch the mind wandering.  Catching the wandering mind and bringing the focus back to the breath is one way to practice dharana.
 
During this pandemic I've found more time in which I can practice dharana.  As a home practitioner, there are some advantages in that there are no other students of which to compare myself to.  In other ways it is harder.  I've caught  myself thinking about what my evening plans are, what I'm going to prepare for dinner, thinking I need to clean under the couch as I can see all those dust bunnies in every downward dog.  Recently I've put less emphasis on this kind of focus.
