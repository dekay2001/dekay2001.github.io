My power is out.  The weather isn't particularly bad, but it is inconvenient that on the night I decided to skip my Taco Tuesday pub run because of the weather and a mild headache, that I would decide to throw a frozen lasagna in the oven, turn up the heat, and relax in my living room.  I estimate that the lasagna was cooking for about 10-15 minutes at temp when the lights started flickering, and my head had been on for maybe 20 minutes since getting home from work.  It also started getting dark around that time so got out a candle that was mostly burnt up for light.  It burnt out.  
 
This is really my only distraction until it comes back on.  I will have to test my baking skills and eyesight to have any idea how much time is left for my dinner.  Luckily there is a pumpkin pie in my fridge that I showed no shame in cutting into for now.  I can't really complain too much since this is the most inconvenience I've had since moving into my home 6.5 years ago.  It could be below freezing and I could have no phone or laptop to keep me busy in the meantime.
 
For my next planned post I was thinking about writing about how I protect myself from my fears by not sharing information with even my closest friends and family.  I could still be doing that right now, however I'm not ready.  My head hurts, and I could get pulled back away into my dinner arrangements at any time.  It's possible I will have more exciting things to report when I do get around to making that post!
