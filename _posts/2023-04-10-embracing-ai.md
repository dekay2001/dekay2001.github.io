## Original Post

Life sometimes feels on hold, but the truth is that it's always moving forward.  It's been four months since my last entry and a lot has happened.  I've been distracted by some of the new upcoming AI technologies that feel like they are on the verge of taking the world by storm.  Chat GPT seems like the real deal.  

I've been using it in favor of Google for inquiries where I am looking for a well thought out explanation and often it gives me satisfactory answers without much need to follow up.  It's made me comfortable in my job when researching specific "how to" questions using Python as the programming language.  I've given interview questions on subject matters in software engineering in which I consider myself an expert in the field, and it gives back answers with better explanations than I would.  It has made me feel comfortable diving into making trades in a personal brokerage account that previously I was hesitant about.  I've asked it for advice on building trello boards to accomplish certain tasks.  I've asked it for suggestions on running routes.  It can also give general guidelines for training programs.  Before I sat down to write this, I was thinking about how this could draft up something for me and post it.  I may still have to revise this entry.  I can imagine how it may be useful for researching any subject matter that I don't know much about.


Overall Chat GPT has been a welcome distraction.  Life is coming fast this year in other facets.  My general feeling is that we should leverage it where we can.  It feels like something that could help a lot of people, but I do worry about our democratic society and how people in power will try to monetize it to fit their agenda that isn't in alignment with what is best for society.  Fingers crossed.


# Chat GPT Revision

Life can sometimes make us feel like it's on hold, but in reality, it's constantly moving forward. It's been four months since my last blog post, and during that time, I've been distracted by the new AI technologies that are emerging and taking the world by storm. Chat GPT, in particular, has caught my attention, and I believe it's the real deal.

I've been using Chat GPT instead of Google for inquiries that require well-thought-out explanations, and it has been delivering satisfactory answers without the need for follow-up questions. It has also made my job easier by helping me research specific "how-to" questions using the Python programming language. I've even used it to give interview questions on software engineering, and it provided better explanations than I could have given.

Aside from work-related tasks, Chat GPT has also been helpful in my personal life. It has given me advice on making trades in my personal brokerage account and has even provided suggestions on building Trello boards, running routes, and general training programs. In fact, before I started writing this post, I even considered asking Chat GPT to draft it up for me.

While Chat GPT has been a welcome distraction, life is coming at me fast in other ways. Nevertheless, I believe we should take advantage of the technology where we can. It has the potential to help a lot of people. However, I am concerned about how people in power might try to monetize it to fit their own agenda, which may not align with what's best for society.

In conclusion, Chat GPT has been a useful tool in both my personal and professional life. However, we must remain vigilant and ensure that its use benefits society as a whole, rather than just a select few.
