## Stuck
 
Recently I was on a trip in Europe with a close friend.  I was excited to have the opportunity to reset myself spiritually, and I had some success.  I don't feel completely revitalized and I'm partly writing this to keep the revitalization momentum going forward.  My lack of entries this year is largely because of a lack of time and motivation.  I've been getting stuck.  During the beginning of the trip we talked a lot about our disposition with our lives and it is evident that my friend's intention and approach is one that I recognize is more inline with what I should be doing.  But when one is stuck like I have been, it's difficult to move in a better direction.
 
## A Shift
 
I can't pinpoint an exact moment, but I think things started feeling a little different in the days surrounding our overnight train ride from Amsterdam to Zurich.  Travel to this point presented some challenges for us, mostly related to navigating to places we wanted to go.  The comedy of wrong turns and minor inconveniences that occurred in Amsterdam to the point of our overnight train ride to Zurich was frustrating and we got through it.  There was a moment on day one where my friend literally said something along the lines of "throwing money at the problem" when we decided to pay for an expensive Uber ride to get to the [Spinoza museum](https://spinozaweb.org/locations/6) outside of town.  This was after failing to find public transportation to our hotel and paying for an expensive taxi to get there, traveling back on public transportation to the airport (where we just came from) to get on a train which we took to the end of the line (when we thought there were more stops) and having to stay on and ride it back one stop where we got off.  Ultimately we got there and we had no sleep from our red eye flight the night before.  
 
The trip back was just as difficult.  A man working at the museum told us where we could catch a bus to go back to the public transportation so that we might avoid an expensive ride back.  We walked maybe a quarter of a mile to the bus stop where a few 20 somethings were sitting, drinking and smoking.  In Dutch, one of them asked us if we were planning to take the bus.  When it was evident that we only spoke English, they informed us the bus wasn't running that day, and together we concluded our best option was to get an Uber to the Leidseplein tram station as it was a hot day and at least an hour walk away.  They left us and we set out to get an Uber.  After 10 minutes went by and no Uber drivers picked us up, we looked up the walking distance and seeing it was 3 miles away, we decided this was acceptable and we walked.  It took more than an hour.

When we got back to the hotel we were able to get our key to finally go to our room.  This was the last bit of comedy, as we were instructed that we could use our key to access a door just outside to get to our loft (Loft 6).  We followed the instructions and found our key didn't open either door.  Back inside we went for help, laughing at ourselves and our epic journey to the Spinoza house.  Turns out the door we were supposed to access was all the way around the building and we hadn't tried our key on the correct doors.  It seemed this was implied, but was not obvious to either of us.  Of course our entry is nowhere near the main hotel entrance!  We entered through the door with our key and proceeded to take 5 flights of stairs up to our loft; no elevators, no surprises.
 
 
## Momentum
 
As challenging as day 1 was for us, we accomplished what we set out to do and we did have more setbacks though not as many for the rest of our trip.  The precedent was set and we would get through this.  Travel isn't so easy.  I wouldn't describe the actual travel part of travel relaxing at all.  Its part of the journey however, and much like all things in life, should be rewarding.  Since returning I have caught myself slipping into negative thought patterns when inconveniences occur and I suppose that catching myself is a first step to changing the pattern.  The flights home from Zurich to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Boston had additional challenges, comedic as well, but I was able to get home safely and fortunately didn't miss any flights, like some of my fellow travel friends experienced.  Yes, I managed to make friends in Frankfort due to a poor Condor flight boarding experience where passengers rotated around a line for hours at our gate where there was a delay that was never posted.  I should have gotten a picture!  It was nice to arrive home after 24 hours of travel and my outlook is better than it was before.  This entry is to remind me to push forward through difficult times, and to keep the positive momentum going forward.  I need to make changes, and changes are coming.
