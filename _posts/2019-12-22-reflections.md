At the end of the year, as I sit down at the coffee shop with the intention to write something meaningful, I find myself looking back over my experiences.  There is a woman playing some beautiful music.  Her voice is beautiful I should say.  Stacey Kellher is her name.  Then there is a yoga class I just came from.  A favorite teacher and friend, [Ankati Day](http://www.ankatiday.com/ "Ankati Day") taught another wonderful class that served both my body and my soul.  My annual family holiday party was last night.  An ever shrinking event for me.  I'm the only one from my immediate family who is able to attend.  A reminder that I should be grateful for these times, as everything changes.  This year has had a certain set of challenges, and I do believe I'm growing.
 
The fall season leading up through the holidays has historically been a time of anxiety for me.  It wasn't always like this.  I do remember loving the season, the family events, the friend parties.  As my family spreads, and my closest friends grow their families, I find myself feeling like my role in all this is being displaced.  Luckily I've added a lot of tools to my toolbox over the same course of time that I can draw on that helps numb the pain of unwanted change.
 
In the early fall I caught up with a friend.  We spoke about the changing of the seasons and my anxiety as the holidays and more change approached.  I told him about my previous year and the life changes that my closest friends were going through and the impacts on my personal life.  Pat and I were both on a spiritual journey in life when we both met in Portugal on a yoga retreat the year before. It was easy to talk on a real level with him.  I brought up concern about my mood and inevitable depression that I knew would be setting in, along with the lack of change and direction in my life.  He pointed out that I was comparing myself to others, and reminded me that it was important to only compare myself now to a previous version of myself.  I know he was right.  
 
It may be hard to detect the changes in life while shrinking it down to the course of a year, and the changes may be subtle.  Even though I'm still living in the same place, working the same job, attending the same yoga classes, and largely hanging out with the same people, there are differences.  I have a new neighbor.  My company upgraded the office space and my role on the team changed twice.  I attended some new yoga classes and studios.  I joined a pub running group on taco Tuesdays.  All of these things are softening the blow of change.  
 
Change shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing.  In many ways it's good.  Change keeps life interesting.  It's ironic that when I'm asked about the changes in my life, I have a hard time coming up with details without really thinking about it.  Sometimes I fail to bring up details because they seem inconsequential in the context of a yearly family meetup.  The same questions will be asked again next year, or so I assume.  
 
The truth is that I expect those questions to come up.  I expect that the family party will happen.  I expect that I will be able to attend and all the same people will be there.  None of these expectations are promises.  With all this, I should be grateful for what I have now.  The seasons of change will come again.  There are no promises.  There should be no expectations.  I'm not the same as I was last year.  I will be different next year, and so will many other things.  Perhaps I will be more grateful for what I have then, and that will be a good change for me.
