I'm tipping, I'm falling, I can't get up.  
Time is always changing, I can't keep up.  
The balance is all off, what the fuck.  
 
I'm coming down now, straight off the cloud.  
Leaping the tallest buildings, I can see the ground.  
It's accelerating, can you believe this, how?  
 
It's so intimidating, the sign is a curse.  
The zodiac is a killer, it's going bezerk.  
All up in my brain, causing some hurt.  
 
Picked a fight with a libra, the tables are turned.  
The pendulum is swinging, its just the begining.  
Looking down now, it will turn around.  
 
My feet touch down, my knees they jerk.  
Beneath the full force, my momentum skirts.  
 
Pushing back hard, my muscles engaged.  
Like Incredible Hulk, I leap with rage.  
 
The ascent is ground breaking, I picked this fight.  
First I pass the trees, things are looking bright.  
It's the way of the world, from darkness comes light.  
 
Tipping the top, the sun sets a blaze.  
My Icarus wings, combustion in flight.  
 
You might have guessed now, a repetitive motion.  
Same as the tides, that move the ocean.  
 
What's here today, is gone tomorrow.  
What comes the day after, it will always follow.
