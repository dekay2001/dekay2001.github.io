Today while I was running, the song [Castle of Glass by Linkin Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScNNfyq3d_w "Castle of Glass Video") came on over my headphones.  The song always gives me energy and catapults my brain into a sea of thoughts.  I was about 40 minutes into my run when it came on, and this is often the time and distance where my body starts to experience what I can only describe as a runner’s high.  In this post I’m going to do my best to describe and explore the seemingly random sequence of euphoric emotions triggered by this combination of music and energy.  In fact, I think it is a pattern triggered by my past experiences combined with my current state of being.

### First Thought (Yes!)
I love this song; I’m going to run harder.  Let’s crank up the speed on this treadmill to 8mph.  

### Second Thought
I am awesome.

### Third Thought (Recalling the past)
Driving on summer days, I remember singing this.  I loved the song back then as well. My thoughts shift; I am like the lyrics say.  

> “Cause I am only a crack in this castle of glass, hardly anything there for you to see”.

### Fourth Thought (Sympathy for past self)
No one knows how I feel inside.  So much sadness experienced.  Does anyone see it?  Maybe it is like a crack in the castle of glass.  Who would notice?

### Fifth Thought (Comparing then and now)
I’m not sad right now.  I’ve come a long way, but the castle is still glass, and there are still cracks.

### Sixth Thought (Brain chatter)
I should write about this.  I want to write about this.  I’ll try and write about this when I go to the coffee shop after my run.

### Seventh Thought (Back to the present)
I am running.  Funny how I was tired just two songs prior, and I still have about 24 minutes to go.  The last two songs I feel good.  My pace is higher.  I am strong.  I feel good.  

### Eighth Thought (Anxiety builds)
Will I feel good after this song?  Will the next 24 minutes be harder because I picked up the pace now?

### Ninth Thought  (Brain chatter)
I’ll unpack this later.  I’ll get through this run.  I can do this.  I need to do this.  I want to get better.
### Tenth Thought (Being present)
Enjoy this song while its happening.  I may not like the next one as much, and I feel strong right now.
