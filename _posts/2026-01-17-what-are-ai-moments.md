## What Are AI Moments?

I started documenting something unusual about six months ago. Not traditional blog posts—those felt too slow, too polished for what was happening. Not just notes either—these needed more structure. I call them "moments," and they're becoming a knowledge base about AI-assisted development and leadership.

But what exactly is a moment? And why am I sharing them on my blog?

## What Is a Moment?

A moment is a micro-learning captured in real-time as I work with AI. It's the instant when a pattern clicks into focus, when I recognize something transferable happening in my collaboration with AI assistants. These aren't polished essays. They're documentation artifacts—the kind of thing you'd write for your future self, knowing you'll forget the details but need to remember the lesson.

They range wildly in scope. Some moments take 10 minutes to capture: "I just shipped a feature in 30 minutes that would have taken me 4 hours." Others take hours to fully explore: "I just realized I've been thinking about AI collaboration completely wrong, and here's the new mental model."

### What Makes Something Moment-Worthy?

Not every insight becomes a moment. I filter for three criteria:

**Patterns that repeat across domains.** If something only works in one narrow context, it's just a tip or trick. If it transfers—if the same pattern shows up in code reviews, in writing, in planning—it's moment-worthy.

**Teaching points for others.** Would this help someone else working with AI? Could they apply this pattern tomorrow? If yes, it's worth documenting.

**Meta-learning—learning about learning.** The most valuable moments are recursive: discoveries about how AI changes the process of discovery itself. When I catch myself noticing something about my own learning process, that's always moment-worthy.

## Why Document Moments Instead of Just Blog Posts?

Here's the paradox: working with AI makes me faster, which means more happens, which means more to learn. Traditional blogging can't keep up with that learning velocity.

### The Velocity Problem

Let me give you an example. In a recent two-week sprint, I:
- Implemented multiple significant features across several projects
- Refactored several codebases for improved maintainability
- Created a comprehensive testing strategy from scratch
- Documented all of it in real-time

Without AI, this might have taken a month or more. With AI, it compressed into days. The learning compressed accordingly. If I waited to "write proper blog posts" about each insight, I'd be six months behind my own understanding.

Moments solve this. I capture the pattern the instant I see it. It takes 15-30 minutes instead of 2-3 hours for a polished post. The velocity matches the velocity of the work.

### From Documentation to Teaching

But moments aren't just faster blog posts. They're part of a learning pipeline:

**Experience** → **Moment** (internal documentation) → **Blog Post** (public teaching) → **Synthesis** (connecting patterns)

Each transformation serves a different purpose:

- **The moment** captures everything: technical details, PR numbers, file paths, version numbers, all the context my future self might need
- **The blog post** extracts ONE core insight, removes internal references, makes it standalone and accessible
- **The synthesis** weaves multiple moments together into a coherent understanding of how AI changes leadership and development

This post you're reading? It started as internal documentation about my documentation process. Meta all the way down.

## How Moments Work in Practice

I've documented 10 moments so far, and they fall into distinct categories:

### The Types of Moments

**Pattern Moments** are reusable templates—checklists, frameworks, decision trees you can apply directly. Example: "The 5-Question Filter for AI-Generated Code" or "The Feature Velocity Checklist."

**Deep Dive Moments** are meta-learning explorations that deserve extended treatment. These are conceptual breakthroughs: "Recognizing when AI is drifting from your intent" or "How to maintain creative control in AI collaboration."

**Velocity Wins** are efficiency breakthroughs—specific techniques that made something dramatically faster. "15-Minute Infrastructure Setup" or "Same-Day Feature Shipping."

**Friction Points** document when things go wrong: "When explicit instructions make things worse" or "The Cost of Over-Specification." These are just as valuable as wins, maybe more so.

### The Moment-to-Blog Pipeline

Not every moment becomes a blog post. I filter for:
- **Standalone lessons** that work without knowing the full Project Alpha context
- **Broad applicability** beyond my specific technical stack
- **Engaging stories** that illustrate the pattern clearly

The transformation process removes all the internal scaffolding (PR numbers, version numbers, governance references) and focuses on teaching the pattern. What you get is the insight without the implementation minutiae.

### Example Journey: Recognizing Organizational Drift

Let me show you how one moment evolved:

**The Experience:** I asked an AI to help refactor some code. Midway through, I realized we'd drifted from "simple refactor" to "complete architectural redesign." The AI wasn't wrong—it was solving what it thought I meant, not what I said.

**The Internal Moment:** 2,000 words documenting exactly what happened, including code snippets, the specific prompts, comparison tables of "What I Asked" vs "What It Built," analysis of where the drift started, a checklist for detecting drift early.

**The Blog Post:** 1,200 words focused on ONE pattern: how to notice when AI collaboration drifts from your intent. Removed all the code details, kept the story and the lesson. Added context about Project Alpha for first-time readers.

**The Synthesis (future):** Will connect this with other communication patterns, exploring how AI changes the nature of delegation and oversight.

Each transformation makes it more accessible, but less comprehensive. The moment is the source of truth; the blog post is the teaching artifact.

## What This Means for Readers

If you're reading this, you're watching a knowledge base being built in public. Every post tagged with `moments` is me working through these patterns in real-time.

### Why I'm Sharing This

First, **transparency.** I'm figuring this out as I go. Sharing the raw process—not just polished conclusions—feels more honest.

Second, **invitation.** Maybe you're working with AI too and noticing similar patterns. Maybe something I'm documenting will click for you. Or maybe you'll notice something I'm missing and tell me about it.

Third, **accountability.** Public documentation creates structure. When I commit to sharing these patterns as I discover them, the practice becomes real and consistent. It's not someday; it's now.

### What to Expect

More moments posts appearing regularly. Some will be polished narratives like this one. Others will be quicker: "Here's a pattern I just discovered, here's why it matters, here's how to use it."

All of them will be tagged with `moments` for easy filtering on my blog. You can follow just these if you want, or mix them with my personal reflections and yoga philosophy posts—your choice.

Some moments might feel incomplete. That's intentional. I'm capturing patterns as I see them, not waiting until I have perfect understanding. If something evolves, I'll document that evolution too.

## The Meta-Moment

This post itself is a moment about moments—documenting the documentation process, explaining the framework I'm using to capture learning at AI velocity.

The pattern here: **AI collaboration requires new forms of learning capture.** Traditional blogging assumes you have time to polish before publishing. Traditional note-taking assumes your notes are private. Moments split the difference: structured enough to be useful, raw enough to be real, public enough to create accountability.

It's an experiment in transparent learning. We'll see where it goes.

## Takeaway

AI Moments are learning artifacts captured at the speed of AI collaboration. They're not blog posts (too raw), not notes (too structured), not synthesis pieces (too early). They're the in-between thing: documentation that becomes teaching that becomes deeper understanding.

You're witnessing a knowledge base being built in public, one pattern at a time. Some moments will resonate with you immediately. Others might make sense only when you encounter similar situations in your own AI work. All of them are pieces of a larger puzzle I'm assembling about how AI changes the nature of software development and leadership.

The most honest thing I can say: I don't know where this ends. I don't know if the conclusion is "I mastered AI collaboration and became dramatically more effective" or "AI eventually automated my job and here's what I learned along the way." Both outcomes could yield valuable insights. Both are possible. I'm documenting the journey regardless.

That's what moments are: honest documentation of a transformation in progress.

Welcome to the experiment.
