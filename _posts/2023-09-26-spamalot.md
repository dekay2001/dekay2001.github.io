## Spamalot: My 15 Seconds of Fame

Two days ago, on September 24th, I found myself unexpectedly back on stage. It all began when I willingly participated in the Broadway musical called [Spamalot](https://spamalotthemusical.com/#about) at [The Portland Players](https://www.portlandplayers.org/). As a huge fan of Monty Python and The Holy Grail, and with the knowledge that my brother was playing a part, I was confident that I would thoroughly enjoy the show. Dennis, aka Sir Galahad, my brother, and the entire cast delivered an amazing performance.

However, I should have done a bit more research about the musical itself, as I wasn't prepared for the surprise waiting under my seat at the end of the show. After some dramatic scenes involving a wickedly dangerous bunny, I suddenly found myself incorporated into the show itself. To my astonishment, I was presented with an award and a Polaroid for my unexpected performance.

They called me by the name "Tim," snapped a Polaroid, and sent me back to my seat. I did my best to act while on stage and then proceeded to have trouble paying attention for the remainder of the show.
