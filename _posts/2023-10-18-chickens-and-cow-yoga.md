# Chickens and Cow Yoga

The world of software development often involves rituals and best practices that may seem mundane on the surface. In the year 2023, most people with access to technology are familiar with the concept of versioning, be it for the latest phones, smartwatches, video game consoles, or Windows operating systems. Yet, little thought is given to the creative origins of some versioning schemes. If you're curious to delve into a unique story, let me share how chickens and cow yoga found their way into the version naming of one of the first Python services my team created.

## V0.1-Rooster

During the holiday season, as I was shopping for gifts, I stumbled upon a book with a striking image of a chicken on its cover—"Extraordinary Chickens." It made for a perfect gift for my close friend and his wife, who appreciated my sense of humor. The following year, I received an "Extraordinary Chickens" calendar from them, which I proudly displayed in my cubicle at work.

That year, as we embarked on building a new product, my team was learning Python and Git for the first time. It was suggested that we tag our critical software releases with version tags. Seeking inspiration, I looked at the calendar in my cubicle and there, V0.1-Rooster was born. The naming algorithm evolved, incorporating different chicken breeds into subsequent versions like "V0.2-Golden-Phoenix," "V0.3-Silkie-Bearded-Buff," and "V0.4-Polish-Frizzle." The flock was upon us.

## A New Year, A New Calendar

Our joy with the chicken calendar was short-lived as a new year brought a new calendar—"Cow Yoga." Unlike its predecessor, this calendar lacked names of bovine varieties or yoga poses. Instead, words like "Patience," "Serenity," and "Balance" adorned each month, becoming inputs for our version tagging algorithm. My personal favorite emerged with "V1.5-Passion." As we transitioned to different technologies, we abandoned this unconventional versioning for more traditional tags when migrating from BitBucket to GitHub. The old versioning scheme was forgotten until yesterday.

## The Return of the Buff

Recently reviving the code and maintaining support for it, we integrated a new CI/CD process using GitHub Actions. A pleasant surprise awaited me as I monitored the logs in the browser—"Silkie-Bearded-Buff" flashed across the screen. Nostalgia swept over me as I uncovered the log history. It was a reminder of the cleverness in an earlier stage of my career.

In many jobs, daily processes can become monotonous. The lesson here is that there are moments when even the most mundane things can be made interesting with inspiration from something as simple as a calendar.
