The dawn of a new decade is here.  It is hopeless to think that the new day could come without looking back at the previous ten years.  A number of life changes have passed by.  Growth has occurred.  Some of the best and worst moments of my life have happened.  I have experienced love, loss, happiness, anger, and sadness.  I bought my first home.  Iâ€™ve been physically and emotionally hurt.  I've travelled to 6 new countries.  I have found new passions and I have come face to face with my darkest moments.  New faces have entered my life, and some were lost.

Last night when all opportunity for new years celebration dissipated after a day full of annoyance, I started down a new path.  The new year and new decade would offer only clear skies in the morning.  Never had I taken the opportunity to watch the sunrise in all my time living on the east coast.  Getting up wouldn't be easy, but how often does a new decade start with a clear forecast, and me with no better place to be?  I set my alarm for 6 AM, and was in bed by 10.  The sun was set to rise at 7:14 AM, enough time for me to drive to a favorite spot in Rye New Hampshire near Odiorne Point.

One decade ago, I think I would have missed out on the opportunity.  One thing I started doing as the decade closed, is assure myself that I could push through discomfort to reap future benefits.  A lesson taught with experiences of heartbreak and physical injury and continued practice.  Old Dan would have dwelled.  With the new decade before me, I am resolved to look at the good with the bad and the ugly as opportunities.  We only get one life.  One chance to make the best of any moment.  There will be more losses, more heartbreak, more misfortune in the next 10 years.  There will also be more life experiences, more growth, more love, and more happiness.
 
Here is to 2020.
