## "Music", Due With the New(Year)
 
I am writing this entry from a surrounding that is not my ideal focussed writing setting.  This entry may not be my best as a result, however I'm telling myself that any life experience is one where maybe some deeper wisdom can be drawn from.  Fun City, may have been more fun had I planned to jump around on the last day of my long weekend. Alas, with my recent car troubles, beggars can't be choosers, it is best if I simply go with the flow I presume.  Throwing on some music will help.
 
And with that, music is truely a thing to behold.  My piano skills are improving with as little as 10-15 minutes of playing a day.  I pretty much run through a few songs I've been practicing, choosing to play whichever one suits my mood the most.  One of the main constants has been my work on [Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU&ab_channel=andrearomano).  There are some pretty good tutorials online, and the beauty of the song hasn't gotten old.  Asside from that, I find that Youtube videos of piano renditions of songs I enjoy provide the right amount of inspiration for me to play for longer blocks of time.  Each song gets me exploring new ways of finding the correct keys up and down the keyboard, left/right hand coordination, and new chord progression familiarity.  Even simpler songs like [Forgot About Dre](https://www.google.com/search?q=forgot+about+dre+piano&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS813US813&oq=Forgot+about+dre+piano&aqs=chrome.0.0i13i512l6j0i390l4.6472j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:ba940763,vid:xtI8wtDZ478) and [Still D.R.E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ7a6gfWDqg&ab_channel=PianoMusic). force the hands to travel up and down the keyboard in ways that translate to other songs that make them easier to get used to.
 
Where is this all going?  Well I am curious about the idea of making my own music using a MIDI controller.  There is a good chance I will be investing some cash to improve my current music setup so that I can install some free music software and string together some different instrumental sounds and beats that I can create.  
 
But first, I feel I need to get my act together at home.  The holidays have been hectic, and my house is in disarray.  I need to downsize to make more of my space so that I can move forward with a setting that will allow me to improve myself.  I expect there will be a chance for some resetting soon.
