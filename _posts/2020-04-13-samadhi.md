Finally we reach samadhi, the final of the eight limbs.  This is the goal.  At this stage one has transcended the Self.  Samadhi cannot be taught nor learned.  It can only be experienced.  If one has mastered the other seven limbs, then the opportunity for samadhi is at its height.  This is a state of ecstacy reached through meditation.  The observer, the observed, and the observing are the same.  They are one.
 
### Samadhi: profound meditation, putting it all together 
 
I've never experienced samadhi.  I've been happy and have experienced joy on more than one occasion, however I cannot recall a time when the joy seemed endless.  I imagine samadhi as being in a state of blissful content.  Without distractions and with complete and utter focus on just being.  I wish I could add more about how I could relate in this time of the pandemic.  
 
This is the final entry related to the 8 limbs, and I have already discarded the piece of paper I mentioned that inspired me to start writing all this.  I think I was trying to set myself up to be more on the way to happiness than I was when I started, and I have accomplished that I believe.  At the very least, it has forced me to focus on a goal for a couple of weeks, and writing all these entries forced me to do some research.  There are a lot of articals online that I feel do a better job of explaining the deeper meanings and origins of the limbs, and I am far from being an expert on the matter.  I've included some links below for further reading.
