"Tell me about Dan with your eyes."  
 
I had just finished an 8 mile run and sat down on a bench in Portsmouth to cool off.  This is when I was approached by a man named Sal.  He had a camera and asked me if he could take my picture.  It was clear that he was a photographer and I had a couple minutes before my parking meter would run out so I agreed.  I didn't know what the photo was for, but since I was in my SIX03 running gear and was still sweating bullets I assumed it was for an article, until he said what he said... 
 
"Tell me about Dan with your eyes."
 
The statement shifted my mindset immediately.  I remembered that I have been experiencing stress and sadness most days in the last month.  I let my face get soft and sat with the feelings while Sal took photos.  Afterwards he gave me his card and told me to check him out on instagram.  He went along his way, and I got in my car to go home and shower.
 
As I drove off, I knew a switch had been flipped in my brain.  I was curious what he saw that made him want to take my picture.  I turned up my music, [Can't Hear You Now by Mike Shinoda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf3lgs_fFnM&ab_channel=MikeShinoda "Can't Hear You Now Video") was on.  The lyrics to the song are fitting for how I was feeling.

Some days it doesn't take much to bring me down
Sometimes I'm struggling for control

```
 
I started singing along on my way home, embracing the emotions and thoughts as they were happening.  I was thinking about what a weird day it had been so far.  I thought about the circumstances and decisions I was making that lead to having my picture taken in a vulnerable state.  Largely I think that I go unnoticed by people in the world. I spend a lot of time in my head.  This specific moment points out that I am largely mistaken.  
 
The reality is that this was the third interaction I had on this day alone that makes it clear.  Earlier in the day I was at a coffee shop killing time before the run because I needed to stop off at the mall before the run to try and pick up a new phone case.  The mall wasn't open yet, so I had a few minutes to try a different drink.  That is where I ran into a member of my running group who sat with me a couple minutes before I would be on my way.  Usually I don't stop for coffee before my runs, so this was a pleasant surprise.
 
The run itself was longer than usual, because I decided to try some side streets for the first time and do an extra mile more than my typical route.  After I was done I cooled off walking around, got another coffee, and didn't move too far from my car.  I had a conversation with some guys waiting to get brunch nearby and they asked about my run after I asked them the time.  I knew I only had a few minutes to cool off, so that is why I walked over to the bench across the street.  This is where Sal saw me.
 
Once I got home I showered and then looked him up on instagram.  Turns out he is a street photographer.  His page shows numerous headshots of others who are like me.  Under each photo is a description of the scenario in which he decided he wanted to take their photos.  
 
Here's one of mine.
